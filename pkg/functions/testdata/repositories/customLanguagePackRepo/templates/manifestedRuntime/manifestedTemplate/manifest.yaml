# template can be invoked.  These settings can be updated on the resultant
# Function as development progresses to ensure 'invoke' can always trigger the
# execution of a running Function instance for testing and development.

  # Formats not understood by the system fall back to this such that there
  # is graceful degredation of service when new formats are added.
